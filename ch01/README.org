* Abount Erlang
** High availability
- Fault-tolerance
- Scalability
- Distribution
- Responsiveness
- Live update
** Erlang concurrency
** Server-side systems

Comparison of technologies used in two real-life web servers:

| Technical requirement  | Server A                     | Server B |
|------------------------+------------------------------+----------|
| HTTP Server            | Nginx and Phusion Passenger  | Erlang   |
| Request processing     | Ruby and Rails               | Erlang   |
| Long-running requests  | Go                           | Erlang   |
| Server-wide state      | Redis                        | Erlang   |
| Persistable data       | Redis and MongoDB            | Erlang   |
| Background jobs        | Cron, Bash scripts, and Ruby | Erlang   |
| Service crash recovery | Upstart                      | Erlang   |


** The development platform

* About Elixir
- Code simpliffication
- Composing functions
- The big picture

* Disadvantages
- Speed
- Ecosystem

* Summary
- Erlang is a technology for developing highly available systems that constantly provide service with little or no downtime. It has been battle tested in diverse large systems for more than two decades.
- Elixir is a modern language that makes development for the Erlang platform much more pleasant. It helps organize code more efficiently and abstracts away boilerplate, noise, and duplication.
